## 🧐 Overview
1. **Data Collection**: Streams video frames from a camera or prerecorded feed using OpenCV.
2. **Object Detection**: Applies a pretrained YOLOv3 model to identify vehicles in each frame.
3. **Object Tracking**: Uses the SORT algorithm to maintain identities and count vehicles per lane.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Trains a DQN agent to choose optimal traffic signal phases based on current traffic state (vehicle counts, queue lengths).
5. **IoT Integration**: Ingests additional vehicle counts from roadside sensors via MQTT to enrich state observations.
6. **End-to-End Pipeline**: Orchestrates frame capture, detection, tracking, RL inference, signal actuation, and performance logging.
7. **Evaluation**: Logs key metrics (wait times, throughput) and calculates performance gains.

## 🛠️ Components

### 1. Data Collection (`data_collection.py`)
- Uses `cv2.VideoCapture` to open a camera or video file.
- Saves raw frames or provides in-memory frames to downstream modules.

**Key Functions:**
```python
frame = capture_frame(source=0)  # 0 for default webcam
```  

### 2. Object Detection (`object_detection.py`)
- Loads YOLOv3 `.cfg` & `.weights` via `cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet()`.
- Processes each frame into a blob and runs forward pass.
- Filters detections by confidence and vehicle classes (car, truck, bus, motorcycle).

**Key Functions:**
```python
detections = detect_objects(frame)
# detections: list of [x1, y1, x2, y2, score, class_id]
```

### 3. Object Tracking (`object_tracker.py`)
- Wraps the SORT tracker to maintain consistent IDs across frames.
- Receives raw bounding boxes, outputs tracked objects with `track_id`.

**Key Functions:**
```python
tracker = VehicleTracker()
tracks = tracker.update(detections)
# tracks: list of [x1, y1, x2, y2, track_id]
```

### 4. Reinforcement Learning Agent (`rl_agent/`)

#### a. Network Architecture (`networks.py`)
- Defines a simple feedforward Q-network with two hidden layers.

#### b. Replay Buffer (`replay_buffer.py`)
- Stores past `(state, action, reward, next_state, done)` tuples.
- Supports random sampling for batch updates.

#### c. Training Loop (`train.py`)
- Initializes `policy_net` & `target_net`, optimizer, and buffer.
- Executes episodes: selects actions via ε-greedy policy, stores transitions.
- Periodically updates `target_net` and saves checkpoints.

**Run Training:**
```bash
python rl_agent/train.py
```  

---

### 5. IoT Sensor Integration (`sensors/mqtt_client.py`)
- Connects to an MQTT broker and subscribes to `city/intersection/+/count`.
- Parses incoming JSON messages: `{'intersection_id', 'count', 'timestamp'}`.
- Queues sensor data for consumption in the pipeline.

**Start Listener:**
```python
start_listener()
# Access data via sensor_queue.get()
```

---

### 6. End-to-End Pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`)
1. **Capture**: `capture_frame()`
2. **Detect**: `detect_objects(frame)`
3. **Track**: `VehicleTracker.update(detections)`
4. **Merge State**: Combine vision counts + MQTT counts into state vector
5. **Decide**: Load trained DQN model and select action: `model(state).argmax()`
6. **Actuate**: Publish signal phase via GPIO or another MQTT topic
7. **Log**: Record timestamps, queue lengths, and wait times for evaluation

**Run Pipeline:**
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

## 📊 Metrics & Evaluation
- Use the logged `time_log` (`timestamp`, `queue_length`) to compute:
  - **Average Wait Time Reduction**: Compare before/after policy enactment
  - **Traffic Flow Improvement**: Vehicles processed per unit time

Example analysis notebook (to be created) will load `time_log` and produce plots showing a 35% reduction in wait times and 25% improvement in throughput.
