## Project Overview
The **Smart Traffic Management System** is an innovative project designed to enhance urban traffic flow and improve road safety through the use of artificial intelligence. By leveraging real-time data collected from cameras and sensors, this system intelligently optimizes traffic signal timings, reducing congestion and waiting times for vehicles and pedestrians alike.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (for building AI models)
  - Flask (for the web application)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
- **Hardware**:
  - Raspberry Pi (for data collection and processing)
  - Intel NUC (for edge computing)

## Project Components
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - The system utilizes cameras and sensors to gather real-time traffic data, including vehicle counts and speeds.
   
2. **AI Models**:
   - **Object Detection**: Implemented using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to identify vehicles and pedestrians in the traffic.
   - **Traffic Flow Prediction**: Historical data is analyzed using machine learning models (LSTM) to predict future traffic patterns.

3. **Traffic Signal Control**:
   - An algorithm dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time data, improving overall traffic management.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Hardware**: Install cameras and sensors in strategic locations to ensure comprehensive data collection.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and label collected data to prepare it for training AI models.
3. **Model Training**: Train the object detection and traffic flow prediction models using the preprocessed data.
4. **Control Algorithm Implementation**: Develop the logic to control traffic signals based on model outputs.
5. **Web Application Development**: Create a user-friendly interface to visualize traffic conditions and manage signals effectively.

## Testing and Evaluation
The system is rigorously tested in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Key performance indicators such as average waiting times, traffic flow, and system accuracy are monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of the traffic management strategies.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart_Traffic_Management_System.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Smart_Traffic_Management_System
   ```
3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. **Access the Web Interface**: Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Future Work
- Integration with more advanced sensors for better accuracy in traffic data collection.
- Expansion of the system to include more complex traffic scenarios, such as emergency vehicle prioritization.
- Implementation of user feedback mechanisms to continually improve system performance.
